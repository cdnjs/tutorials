## Introduction

We want you to help us write awesome Community driven open source web development tutorials!. By developers, for developers.

Here's a simple list of questions to help you figure out if you should publish a web development tutorial on cdnjs:

* Do you love web development?
* Do you want to help other people learn web development?
* Did you just learn about something awesome that you think other people would find awesome too?

If you answered yes to any of the above, we want you to write a web development tutorial and publish it on cdnjs! It's super easy!

## Contributing

Simply fork the repository and copy the [example tutorial](https://github.com/cdnjs/tutorials/tree/master/backbone.js/organizing-backbone-using-modules)

Each tutorial should have a master `index.md` file which will contain the contents of your tutorial. And it should also contain a `tutorial.json` file which contains all the meta information about your tutorial.

We want to make a super beautiful and useful tutorial system where anyone can get setup in minutes.

## Tutorial Listings

Tutorials show under each associated library on the [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com) website, and are also all available via the [API](https://cdnjs.com/api). At the moment we don't have support for generic JavaScript tutorials but please leave an issue if you want to write one.
