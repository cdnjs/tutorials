## Cdnjs Tutorials

### Overview

We want you to help us write awesome web development tutorials! Community driven open source tutorials. By developers, for developers.

Here's a simple list of questions to help you figure out if you should publish a web development tutorial on cdnjs:
- Do you love web development?
- Do you want to help other people learn web development?
- Did you just learn about something awesome that you think other people would find awesome too?

If you answered yes to any of the above, we want you to write a web developemnt tutorial and publish it on cdnjs! It's super easy!

### Instructions

Simply fork the repository and copy the [example tutorial](https://github.com/cdnjs/tutorials/tree/master/backbone.js/organizing-backbone-using-modules)

Each tutorial should have a master `index.md` file which will contain the contents of your tutorial. And it should also contain a `tutorial.json` file which contains all the meta information about your tutorial.

We want to make a super beautiful and useful tutorial system where anyone can get setup in minutes.

## Tutorial Listings

Tutorials show under each associated library. At the moment we don't have support for generic Javascript tutorials but please leave an issue if you want to write one.

## Why host your tutorial on cdnjs?

* [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com) is visited by hundreds of thousands of web developers every month.
* You don't have to worry about setting up an elegant website to display your tutorials.
* Authors get full credit and can remove their work at any time.
* Everything is hosted on Github so the community can easily help fix bugs and grammatic mistakes in your tutorials.
* Cdnjs is a completely volunteer driven effort where we pay for bills out of our own pockets. Writing tutorials increases our advertising revenue which means we can better improve the project.
