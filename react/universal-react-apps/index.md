## Introduction 

Next.js is a framework for quickly building universal (also called Isomorphic) server-rendered web apps with 
React. In this tutorial you will learn essential concepts of server-rendered React apps by creating a demo app with Next.js.

Building apps with Next.js is simple. You just create a <em>pages</em> directory and place React components in it.
 Next.js will take care of everything else.

This tutorial was originally published in [techiediaries](https://www.techiediaries.com/universal-react-apps-nextjs/)

Now let's get started 

First we need to install the required tools:

## Installing Next.js 2.0 

You can install Next.js 2.0 via npm with:

    npm install --save next react react-dom

## Installing Next.js 3.0 

 Next.js 3.0 is still in beta, you can also install it via npm with:

    npm install next@beta react react-dom --save


## Adding NPM Scripts to package.json 

Building apps with Next.js is a matter of using three commands:

    next
    next build
    next start 

So lets add NPM scripts to trigger these commands: 

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },


## Adding Pages 

To create pages you first need to create a pages directory:

    mkdir pages 

### Adding the Home Page 

Create an index.js file inside pages folder and put this content in it:

    import Link from 'next/link'
    export default () => (
    <div>
                <Link href='/'><a>Home</a></Link> -
                <Link href='/about'><a>About Me</a></Link> - 
                <Link href='/contact'><a>Contact</a></Link>  
                <br></br>
                <p>This is the home page</p>
                
    </div>
    )


### Adding the About Page

Next create an about.js file inside pages folder then put the following content:

    import Link from 'next/link'
    export default () => (
    <div>
                <Link href='/'><a>Home</a></Link> -
                <Link href='/about'><a>About Me</a></Link> - 
                <Link href='/contact'><a>Contact</a></Link>  
                <br></br>
                <p>This is about page</p>
    </div>
    )


### Adding the Contact Page 

Add contact.js file inside pages folder then put the following:

    import Link from 'next/link'
    export default () => (
    <div>
                <Link href='/'><a>Home</a></Link> -
                <Link href='/about'><a>About Me</a></Link> - 
                <Link href='/contact'><a>Contact</a></Link>  
                <br></br>
                <p>This is the contact page</p>
                
    </div>
    )



Now you can launch next with:

    npm run dev 

Your app will be available from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

As you can see the names of files inside pages directory become the routes except for / which points to index.js

## Conclusion 

Universal apps become very popular in these days and thanks to React and Next.js you can build them in a matter 
of a few commands.
