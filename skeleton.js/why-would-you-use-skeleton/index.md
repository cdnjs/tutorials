# Why do you need Skeleton.js?

Building a web app nowadays is a challenge. You need to render dynamic views, take care of user inputs, show popups, etc.
And if you are building a single page app, life gets even more difficult, since most likely you need a front-end router,
templates and more.
Skeleton.js is a tiny library, but still it manages to answer all of the above in an elegant, easy-to-use way.
give the tutorial 10 minutes and you will see why.
Please follow the below order:
* Templates, Models, Lists
* Forms
* Router
* Functions
* Subscriptions
* Starter

> But first, please read this short but very clear documentation: [skeleton documentation](https://github.com/guypeer8/skeleton.js).

Now that you are done reading, in the next tutorial we will start setting up a TodoMVC application, step by step.
